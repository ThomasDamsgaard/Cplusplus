# Void
Void is the easiest of the data types to explain. Basically, void means “no type”!

# Signed integers
When writing negative numbers in everyday life, we use a negative sign. For example, -3 means “negative 3”. We’d also typically recognize +3 as “positive 3” (though common convention dictates that we typically omit plus prefixes). This attribute of being positive, negative, or zero is called the number’s sign.
Prefer the shorthand types that do not use the int suffix or signed prefix.

# Unsigned integers
Many developers (and some large development houses, such as Google) believe that developers should generally avoid unsigned integers.
